/*Rename the first form 'while'.
Each time the loop runs, it must output a line of text that shows the value of i at that iteration of the loop.
The output must be to the console, in this format:

     This is loop iteration 1.
     This is loop iteration 2.
     etc.         
When the loop is done, it must output: 
     The loop is now done.
